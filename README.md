Problem Statement

You have n dark stores in a city.

Each dark store has an ID, location (x,y coordinates), and inventory (product → quantity mapping).

When a product’s quantity in one dark store goes below a threshold, an algorithm should:

1.Search nearby dark stores that have enough stock of that product.

2.Suggest which store to transfer from (maybe the closest one, or one with maximum stock).
